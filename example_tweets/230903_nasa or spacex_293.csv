Now X Tesla and SpaceX are ALL being investigated/sued by the Biden administration!1. TESLA: The DOJ and the SEC this week claimed Musk used millions of dollars from Tesla to secretly build himself a ‘spacious glass structure’ labelled as House for CEO Elon MuskFox’s Jesse Waters described these investigations as having “less to do about glass houses and more to do with Biden exacting revenge on Musk for buying Twitter”Elon replied to Jesse: “This is one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard. Where is this house!? Metaphors don’t count!”2. X/TWITTER: X got in trouble with the Biden Administration after refusing to hand over to prosecutors Trump’s personal Twitter data and information.The information included:- Trump’s use of the account - Whether others had access to it - Whether he might have written draft tweets that he left unposted.Twitter initially resisted complying with the search warrant arguing that the order violated Trump’s constitutional right of free speech resulting in a federal judge holding the company in contempt and fining it $350000.3. SPACEX: It doesn’t stop there… This week the DOJ sued SpaceX for discriminating against refugees in the company’s hiring process. They claim the company discourage refugees from applying for positions giving their applications unfair consideration and refusing to hire them even if they were deemed qualified applicants.Is Elon being targeted for political reasons?

elonmusk,the biden administrations politically weaponized doj is suing spacex for hiring american citizens to work on cuttingedge rocket technology instead of prioritizing refugees  in 2016 elonmusk was asked why spacex doesnt hire nonus citizens  unfortunately this is not up to us us government regulations make it hard to get a job in the us but if you are working on rocket technology thats considered advanced weapons technology   so even a normal work visa isnt sufficient unless you get special permission from the secretary of defense or the secretary of state so i want to be clear this is not out of some desire of spacex to just hire people with green cards  its because we are not allowed to do anything else its not a wise policy for us because there are so many talented people all around the world that we would love to have work at our company   but unless they somehow get a green card were legally prevented from hiring anyone for example this is not the case at tesla  about 30 of our engineering team is outside the us because we dont have the itar restriction so i really wish we could do more its just our hands are tied,The Biden administrations politically weaponized DOJ is suing SpaceX for hiring American citizens to work on cutting-edge rocket technology instead of prioritizing refugees.In 2016 @ElonMusk was asked why SpaceX doesnt hire non-U.S. citizens?Unfortunately this is not up to us. U.S. government regulations make it hard to get a job in the U.S. but if you are working on rocket technology thats considered advanced weapons technology. So even a normal work visa isnt sufficient unless you get special permission from the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of State. So I want to be clear this is not out of some desire of SpaceX to just hire people with green cards.Its because we are not allowed to do anything else. Its not a wise policy for us because there are so many talented people all around the world that we would love to have work at our company... But unless they somehow get a green card were legally prevented from hiring anyone... For example this is not the case at Tesla...About 30% of our engineering team is outside the U.S. because we dont have the ITAR restriction. So I really wish we could do more. Its just our hands are tied.,09/02/2023,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.32,0.53,3,6,0.9698,-1,0.724236786365509

Now X Tesla and SpaceX are ALL being investigated/sued by the Biden administration!1. TESLA: The DOJ and the SEC this week claimed Musk used millions of dollars from Tesla to secretly build himself a ‘spacious glass structure’ labelled as House for CEO Elon MuskFox’s Jesse Waters described these investigations as having “less to do about glass houses and more to do with Biden exacting revenge on Musk for buying Twitter”Elon replied to Jesse: “This is one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard. Where is this house!? Metaphors don’t count!”2. X/TWITTER: X got in trouble with the Biden Administration after refusing to hand over to prosecutors Trump’s personal Twitter data and information.The information included:- Trump’s use of the account - Whether others had access to it - Whether he might have written draft tweets that he left unposted.Twitter initially resisted complying with the search warrant arguing that the order violated Trump’s constitutional right of free speech resulting in a federal judge holding the company in contempt and fining it $350000.3. SPACEX: It doesn’t stop there… This week the DOJ sued SpaceX for discriminating against refugees in the company’s hiring process. They claim the company discourage refugees from applying for positions giving their applications unfair consideration and refusing to hire them even if they were deemed qualified applicants.Is Elon being targeted for political reasons?

Yung mga props ni jvke nasa likod and couldn’t be moved anymore. And because they came from a place of “nothing” before (I used this word loosely obviously where they had to share 2-3 mics work with subpar equipments and technical glitches) they were able to make it work like it was easy-peasy but I bet it was challenging. So if y’all see some small issues with choreo remember the environment they had to adapt to.

Jobiz042,biden and the doj target elon musk  remember when biden didnt invite elon or mention tesla at the white house electric vehicle summit  well now x tesla and spacex are all being investigatedsued by the biden administration  1 tesla the doj and the sec this week claimed musk used millions of dollars from tesla to secretly build himself a spacious glass structure labelled as house for ceo elon musk  foxs jesse waters described these investigations as having less to do about glass houses and more to do with biden exacting revenge on musk for buying twitter  elon replied to jesse this is one of the funniest things ive ever heard where is this house metaphors dont count  2 xtwitter x got in trouble with the biden administration after refusing to hand over to prosecutors trumps personal twitter data and information  the information included   trumps use of the account   whether others had access to it   whether he might have written draft tweets that he left unposted  twitter initially resisted complying with the search warrant arguing that the order violated trumps constitutional right of free speech resulting in a federal judge holding the company in contempt and fining it 350000  3 spacex it doesnt stop there this week the doj sued spacex for discriminating against refugees in the companys hiring process   they claim the company discourage refugees from applying for positions giving their applications unfair consideration and refusing to hire them even if they were deemed qualified applicants  is elon being targeted for political reasons or is this more about twitterx defending free speech,🚨BIDEN AND THE DOJ TARGET ELON MUSKRemember when Biden didn’t invite Elon or mention Tesla at the White House Electric Vehicle Summit?Well... Now X Tesla and SpaceX are ALL being investigated/sued by the Biden administration!1. TESLA: The DOJ and the SEC this week claimed Musk used millions of dollars from Tesla to secretly build himself a ‘spacious glass structure’ labelled as House for CEO Elon MuskFox’s Jesse Waters described these investigations as having “less to do about glass houses and more to do with Biden exacting revenge on Musk for buying Twitter”Elon replied to Jesse: “This is one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard. Where is this house!? Metaphors don’t count!”2. X/TWITTER: X got in trouble with the Biden Administration after refusing to hand over to prosecutors Trump’s personal Twitter data and information.The information included:- Trump’s use of the account - Whether others had access to it - Whether he might have written draft tweets that he left unposted.Twitter initially resisted complying with the search warrant arguing that the order violated Trump’s constitutional right of free speech resulting in a federal judge holding the company in contempt and fining it $350000.3. SPACEX: It doesn’t stop there… This week the DOJ sued SpaceX for discriminating against refugees in the company’s hiring process. They claim the company discourage refugees from applying for positions giving their applications unfair consideration and refusing to hire them even if they were deemed qualified applicants.Is Elon being targeted for political reasons? Or is this more about Twitter/X defending Free Speech?,09/03/2023,0.06,0.0,0.25,0.34,0.34,-12,0,-0.8503,0,0.9196438789367676

Now X Tesla and SpaceX are ALL being investigated/sued by the Biden administration!1. TESLA: The DOJ and the SEC this week claimed Musk used millions of dollars from Tesla to secretly build himself a ‘spacious glass structure’ labelled as House for CEO Elon MuskFox’s Jesse Waters described these investigations as having “less to do about glass houses and more to do with Biden exacting revenge on Musk for buying Twitter”Elon replied to Jesse: “This is one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard. Where is this house!? Metaphors don’t count!”2. X/TWITTER: X got in trouble with the Biden Administration after refusing to hand over to prosecutors Trump’s personal Twitter data and information.The information included:- Trump’s use of the account - Whether others had access to it - Whether he might have written draft tweets that he left unposted.Twitter initially resisted complying with the search warrant arguing that the order violated Trump’s constitutional right of free speech resulting in a federal judge holding the company in contempt and fining it $350000.3. SPACEX: It doesn’t stop there… This week the DOJ sued SpaceX for discriminating against refugees in the company’s hiring process. They claim the company discourage refugees from applying for positions giving their applications unfair consideration and refusing to hire them even if they were deemed qualified applicants.Is Elon being targeted for political reasons? Or is this more about Twitter/X defending Free Speech?,09/03/2023,0.06,0.0,0.25,0.34,0.34,-12,0,-0.8503,0,0.9196438789367676
