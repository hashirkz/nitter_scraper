elonmusk,the biden administrations politically weaponized doj is suing spacex for hiring american citizens to work on cuttingedge rocket technology instead of prioritizing refugees  in 2016 elonmusk was asked why spacex doesnt hire nonus citizens  unfortunately this is not up to us us government regulations make it hard to get a job in the us but if you are working on rocket technology thats considered advanced weapons technology   so even a normal work visa isnt sufficient unless you get special permission from the secretary of defense or the secretary of state so i want to be clear this is not out of some desire of spacex to just hire people with green cards  its because we are not allowed to do anything else its not a wise policy for us because there are so many talented people all around the world that we would love to have work at our company   but unless they somehow get a green card were legally prevented from hiring anyone for example this is not the case at tesla  about 30 of our engineering team is outside the us because we dont have the itar restriction so i really wish we could do more its just our hands are tied,The Biden administrations politically weaponized DOJ is suing SpaceX for hiring American citizens to work on cutting-edge rocket technology instead of prioritizing refugees.In 2016 @ElonMusk was asked why SpaceX doesnt hire non-U.S. citizens?Unfortunately this is not up to us. U.S. government regulations make it hard to get a job in the U.S. but if you are working on rocket technology thats considered advanced weapons technology. So even a normal work visa isnt sufficient unless you get special permission from the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of State. So I want to be clear this is not out of some desire of SpaceX to just hire people with green cards.Its because we are not allowed to do anything else. Its not a wise policy for us because there are so many talented people all around the world that we would love to have work at our company... But unless they somehow get a green card were legally prevented from hiring anyone... For example this is not the case at Tesla...About 30% of our engineering team is outside the U.S. because we dont have the ITAR restriction. So I really wish we could do more. Its just our hands are tied.,09/02/2023,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.32,0.53,3,6,0.9698,-1,0.724236786365509

TESLA: The DOJ and the SEC this week claimed Musk used millions of dollars from Tesla to secretly build himself a ‚Äòspacious glass structure‚Äô labelled as House for CEO Elon MuskFox‚Äôs Jesse Waters described these investigations as having ‚Äúless to do about glass houses and more to do with Biden exacting revenge on Musk for buying Twitter‚ÄùElon replied to Jesse: ‚ÄúThis is one of the funniest things I‚Äôve ever heard. Where is this house!? Metaphors don‚Äôt count!‚Äù2. X/TWITTER: X got in trouble with the Biden Administration after refusing to hand over to prosecutors Trump‚Äôs personal Twitter data and information.The information included:- Trump‚Äôs use of the account - Whether others had access to it - Whether he might have written draft tweets that he left unposted.Twitter initially resisted complying with the search warrant arguing that the order violated Trump‚Äôs constitutional right of free speech resulting in a federal judge holding the company in contempt and fining it $350000.3. SPACEX: It doesn‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶ This week the DOJ sued SpaceX for discriminating against refugees in the company‚Äôs hiring process. They claim the company discourage refugees from applying for positions giving their applications unfair consideration and refusing to hire them even if they were deemed qualified applicants.Is Elon being targeted for political reasons?

TESLA: The DOJ and the SEC this week claimed Musk used millions of dollars from Tesla to secretly build himself a ‚Äòspacious glass structure‚Äô labelled as House for CEO Elon MuskFox‚Äôs Jesse Waters described these investigations as having ‚Äúless to do about glass houses and more to do with Biden exacting revenge on Musk for buying Twitter‚ÄùElon replied to Jesse: ‚ÄúThis is one of the funniest things I‚Äôve ever heard. Where is this house!? Metaphors don‚Äôt count!‚Äù2. X/TWITTER: X got in trouble with the Biden Administration after refusing to hand over to prosecutors Trump‚Äôs personal Twitter data and information.The information included:- Trump‚Äôs use of the account - Whether others had access to it - Whether he might have written draft tweets that he left unposted.Twitter initially resisted complying with the search warrant arguing that the order violated Trump‚Äôs constitutional right of free speech resulting in a federal judge holding the company in contempt and fining it $350000.3. SPACEX: It doesn‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶ This week the DOJ sued SpaceX for discriminating against refugees in the company‚Äôs hiring process.

Where is this house!? Metaphors don‚Äôt count!‚Äù2. X/TWITTER: X got in trouble with the Biden Administration after refusing to hand over to prosecutors Trump‚Äôs personal Twitter data and information.The information included:- Trump‚Äôs use of the account - Whether others had access to it - Whether he might have written draft tweets that he left unposted.Twitter initially resisted complying with the search warrant arguing that the order violated Trump‚Äôs constitutional right of free speech resulting in a federal judge holding the company in contempt and fining it $350000.3. SPACEX: It doesn‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶ This week the DOJ sued SpaceX for discriminating against refugees in the company‚Äôs hiring process.

UncleGlenn32,thought to share another fancam to give a perspective on how relatively small the stage was for the 5 of them and their very dynamic choreography yung mga props ni jvke nasa likod and couldnt be moved anymore and because they came from a place of nothing before i used this word loosely obviously where they had to share 23 mics work with subpar equipments and technical glitches they were able to make it work like it was easypeasy but i bet it was challenging so if yall see some small issues with choreo remember the environment they had to adapt to wala lang i just admire them more because of their professionalism and flexibility tapos parang wala lang carry lang nagworry pa kami for nothing lol galing nyo sobra   the view up top wasnt that great  pls excuse the cable hanging from the ceiling and blocking the view    sb19official sb19 jvkewhattourfeelslikewithsb19,Thought to share another fancam to give a perspective on how relatively small the stage was for the 5 of them and their very dynamic choreography. Yung mga props ni jvke nasa likod and couldn‚Äôt be moved anymore. And because they came from a place of ‚Äúnothing‚Äù before (I used this word loosely obviously where they had to share 2-3 mics work with subpar equipments and technical glitches) they were able to make it work like it was easy-peasy but I bet it was challenging. So if y‚Äôall see some small issues with choreo remember the environment they had to adapt to. Wala lang I just admire them more because of their professionalism and flexibility tapos parang wala lang carry lang.
